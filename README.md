# Notes on implementation
- I have implemented the [task](https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/tdd-assessment/) including the bonus points [tasks](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/).
- I have used 2 separate commits for each "feature": one with a failing test (unless it passes automatically) and the other with the code implementation that passes the test. Ideally, I could have used branching for each feature and squash merged the test plus implementation into the main branch together. This will help clarity, but to keep things simple for this assessment, I make commits directly into the main branch â€” one for the test that fails and the other for the implementation that passes the test (if needed).
- I could have implemented additional tests and code modifications for checking the format of the input string: for example, I could check if the input string starts with '//' but doesn't specify a delimiter and raised an appropriate exception for it. I could also check whether the right delimiters are declared (e.g "//[;]\n2***3" declares ";" as delimiter but actually uses "\*\*\*"). But for simplicity, I have restricted the scope of the code/tests by assuming that inputs will come in the right format and don't have to be doublechecked.
